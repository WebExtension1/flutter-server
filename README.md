This project was an unmarked portion of a university assignment. The marked portion can be found [here](https://github.com/WebExtension1/flutter-social-app).

Due to this, the structure and code quality, particularly in previous iterations, may not reflect my best work. However, I've chosen to keep this public because it showcases my first experience working with sockets, a major skill I've since developed.

Following this assignment, I plan on making a web app where I'll make more efficient and organised use of sockets.
